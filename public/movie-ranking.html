<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  Spirited Away changed the landscape of animated film, being the only animated
  film to win an Oscar.
</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>Arrival is a mental gymnastics trip that is well worth a second watch.</p>

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>
  Baby Driver showed what a good soundtrack can do for a film. It adds extra
  layers of captivation in an enchanting way.
</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  What's crazy about Interstellars being so wild, is that it's actually very
  scientifically accurate on much of it's theoretical portrayals.
</p>

<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>
  Martin Scorses created maybe the best gangster classic of all time. The
  telling of the story through self-narration was the absolute perfect choice
  here.
</p>

<h3>Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>
  Insanely vulgar; Insanely fun. My personal favorite follow-up of Goodfellas
  from Scorsese.
</p>

<h3>The Northman</h3>
<p>
  A visual marvel of epic proportions with a very distinct style. It's
  definitely artsy and not for everyone, but it's worth a single watch for sure.
</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>
  The extremely rare case of a long awaited sequel that somehow surpasses the
  original and without ruining the original groundwork for old fans.
</p>

<h3>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One</h3>
<p>
  Somehow Tom Cruise followed up the insane stunts of Top Gun: Maverick with
  even more wild stunts. At this point I'm worried his adrenaline-junkie
  inner-self is going to lead to a sad fate.
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  Heath Ledger gave the performance of a lifetime as The Joker and proved it's
  possible to truly take the lead role as a Villain in entertainment.
</p>

<h3>The Goonies</h3>
<p>
  A childhood favorite of mine that is part of the peak 80s feel-good movies
  many grew up on and with.
